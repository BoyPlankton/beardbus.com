        c0ldbru and SteveJabs are currently hurtling towards DEF CON in a vehicular spectacle that's part post-apocalyptic chaos, part high-speed chase, and part good ol' fashioned banditry. Think Mad Max meets the Cannonball Run with a dash of Smokey and the Bandit, but with more tech talk and probably less law enforcement. You won't believe the insane antics, technical wizardry, and general mayhem they're cooking up. To witness this adrenaline-fueled adventure firsthand, tune into their Twitch stream immediately. Let's see if they survive the journey!
